Q: Is your jewelry real gold?
Yes! Every Tomi piece is made with real solid gold — never gold-plated or gold-filled. We specialize in 9K, 10K, and 14K solid gold.

Q: What’s the difference between 9K, 10K, 14K, and 18K gold?
The number represents how much pure gold is in the piece. 9K is 37.5% gold, 10K is 41.7%, 14K is 58.3%, and 18K is 75%. All are real gold.

Q: Do your pieces tarnish or turn green?
No. Our jewelry is solid gold, so it won’t tarnish or turn your skin green.

Q: Are your diamonds real?
Yes! We use natural GH-SI quality diamonds that are conflict-free and ethically sourced.

Q: Do you use recycled gold?
We do. All Tomi pieces are made with recycled gold.
