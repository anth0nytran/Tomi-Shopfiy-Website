PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (“TERMS”) CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE, CREATING AN ACCOUNT, OR PLACING AN ORDER, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THE SITE.

1) ELIGIBILITY
You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to make a purchase from the Site.

2) ACCOUNTS
You may be able to create an account on the Site. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity under your account. You agree to provide accurate information and to keep your account information up to date. We may suspend or terminate accounts that we reasonably believe are being used for fraud, abuse, or unlawful activity.

3) PRODUCTS; MATERIALS; NATURAL VARIATION
We sell 14k gold jewelry (including chains, hoops, rings, necklaces, earrings/flatbacks) and items that may include natural gemstones (including jade, moonstone, topaz, sapphire, peridot, tourmaline, labradorite, opal, garnet), natural pearls, diamonds (natural unless otherwise stated on the product page), and abalone shell accents.

Natural stones, pearls, and shell materials can vary in color, pattern, clarity, and appearance. Product photos are for illustrative purposes and may differ from the actual item due to natural variation and device display settings.

4) PRICING, CURRENCY, TAXES
Currency. All prices are listed in USD.

Taxes. Prices shown do NOT include sales tax. Taxes are calculated automatically at checkout based on the customer’s location. Shipping charges are subject to tax where applicable.

Pricing Errors. We reserve the right to correct pricing, typographical, or other errors at any time. If an item is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information, we may cancel or refuse any order placed for that item, even if the order has been confirmed and/or charged.

5) ORDERS; ACCEPTANCE; CANCELLATIONS
Placing an Order. Submitting an order is an offer to purchase. We may accept, reject, or cancel orders at our discretion, including due to inventory limitations, suspected fraud, payment authorization issues, or other circumstances.

Order Acceptance. An order is not guaranteed to be accepted until we confirm fulfillment/shipment or otherwise confirm acceptance.

Cancellations. If you need to request a cancellation, contact support@tomijewelry.com as soon as possible. We will attempt to accommodate cancellation requests; however, once an order has begun processing or has shipped, cancellation may not be possible. Custom items are final sale (see Section 9).

6) PAYMENT PROCESSING
Payments are processed through Shopify Payments. You represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provide. We do not store full payment card numbers. Payment information is handled by our payment processor(s) subject to their terms and policies.

7) SHIPPING & DELIVERY
We ship to the United States and internationally.

Domestic (Flat Rate)
• Express: 1–2 business days — $20
• Standard: 1–5 business days — $8

International (Flat Rate)
• Express International: 1–5 business days — $45
• Standard International: 6–12 business days — $25

Shipping Timeframes. The timeframes above are estimates and are not guarantees. Delivery times may vary due to carrier delays, customs processing, holidays, weather, and other factors outside our control.

International Duties/Taxes. International shipments may be subject to import duties, taxes, and fees assessed by the destination country. These charges are the customer’s responsibility unless we explicitly state otherwise at checkout.

8) RISK OF LOSS; LOST OR STOLEN PACKAGES
Once the carrier confirms delivery to the address provided at checkout, the customer is responsible for the package. If a package is lost after carrier-confirmed delivery, customers should file a claim with the carrier. We will assist with reasonable documentation when available but cannot offer refunds or replacements for carrier-confirmed deliveries.
